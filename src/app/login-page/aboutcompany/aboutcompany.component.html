      <p >Undoubtedly telemarketing can still play an important part in your customer communication and marketing strategy, but only if it’s undertaken in the correct manner. In recent years the industry has suffered and gained a somewhat bad reputation from unscrupulous operators both on-shore and off-shore whose philosophy has been to chuck enough mud at the wall and hope that some of it will stick?</p>

          <p><u><b>LEAD GENERATION:- </b></u></p>
          <p><b>WHAT IS LEAD GENERATION?</b></p>
          <p >Lead generation describes the marketing process of stimulating and capturing interest in a product or service for the purpose of developing sales pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>Lead generation often uses digital channels, and has been undergoing substantial changes in recent years from the rise of new online and social techniques. In particular, the abundance of information readily available online has led to the rise of the “self-directed buyer” and the emergence of new techniques to develop and qualify potential leads before passing them to sales. </p>

            <p><b>WHY IS LEAD GENERATION IMPORTANT?</b></p>
            <p >The buying process has changed, and marketers need to find new ways to reach buyers and get heard through the noise.  Instead of finding customers with mass advertising and email blasts, marketers must now focus on being found and learn to build continuous relationships with buyers.

            <p><b><u>TELEMARKETING SERVICES:</u></b></p>
            <p >Telemarketing is a marketing strategy that involves connecting with customers over the telephone or, more recently, through web-based video conferencing. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p >Telemarketing is one of the most divisive strategies in modern marketing because many organizations have been known to use irritating or unethical practices in telemarketing. One of the most negatively-perceived versions of telemarketing is known as “robo-calling,” a practice that involves using a pre-recorded message delivered through an automatic dialing machine that can contact thousands of people every day. Because of these and other unpopular methods, there are many government regulations of telemarketing in several countries throughout the world.

              </p>
              <br>
              <p >Telemarketing can help a wide variety of organizations achieve improved results in different ways. Though the most obvious form of telemarketing involves company calls to individuals at home to pitch them products, telemarketing is also a significant strategy in business-to-business sales, event promotion, political campaigning, and lead generation for more sophisticated sales procedures.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p >Companies that wish to promote an event that appeals to a specific demographic can also use telemarketing to reach potential participants. For instance, a company that organizes continuing education conferences for dentists could use telemarketing to contact a large number of dental practices to raise awareness about an upcoming conference, and encourage the dentists to attend.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p >Telemarketing can be used to achieve several different business goals, including:</p>
                     <p> Selling a product </p>
                     <p> Generating leads for a sales team </p>
                     <p> Conducting surveys and collecting consumer data </p>
                     <p> Maintaining contact with existing customers or encouraging previous customers to return.</p>
